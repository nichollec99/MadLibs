Piggie began to %. "Will we % ?" asked Piggie. "Of course" Gerald said. "So we will need to pack # ." Piggie
% home to try and find # to take with them. Gerald % in his closet to get a # in case it rained. "I think we might need
# so we don't get to hungry." Piggie said when she returned. They made sure to pack # to munch on. "I really hope we get to
% in the ocean when we get there!" Piggie said. So Gerald and Piggie jumped in their # and left. "What should we do after
this?" Gerald asked. "Maybe we could try to %" Piggie said.
